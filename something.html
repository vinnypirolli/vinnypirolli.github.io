	After reading “As we may think” and “Long Live the Web”, i noticed a few parallels. In Vannevar Bush’s writing “as We May Think”, the internet, hypertext, and the world wide web were somewhat predicted and mentioned (not by the same name as it wasn’t invented yet) as something that would potentially be made in the future. The writer of “Long Live the Web”, (Tim Berners-Lee) actually created the world wide web. Bush was able to think forward, predicting technology. Lee’s article also looks forward and talks about the future of the web. He mentions open data and social machines as up and coming features. Social machines are very popular now a days, with sites like yelp. Both articles were able to look in the future, predicting features that would become very relevant in modern day.

	I found it interesting how Bush was able to somewhat predict the world wide web, and now Lee is reflecting on it after it being a thing for 20 years (written in 2010). The two articles are 65 years apart and although that may seem like a big gap to some, technology is rapidly evolving in the mean time. The fact that Bush was able to predict so many modern day technologies is fascinating but the fact he was able to predict them in 1945 makes it somewhat unsettling. I also found it interesting how Lee mentions some concerns about the world wide web being "threatened". He mentions things like social media walling off info from other parts of the web, and higher ups spying on our data. Although Bush was right about his predictions regarding modern day technology to some point, it seems as if they're some dangers with the outcomes which is something I'm sure Bush would of never thought of back in 1945. I think it would be really amazing to see Vannevar and Tim have a conversation today to talk about the internet and the world of technology as we know it.</p>
