	In episode 1, The idea of prints are very interesting, because I understand both sides. I get that taking a famous image (for example Mona Lisa), and having prints of it could saturate it, taking away the magic of the real image. But at the same time, If you were to ever see the real Mona Lisa it would still be a huge deal. I think you would still be able to feel the presence of it despite it being printed elsewhere. I think personally, if I was to see an image like starry night or Mona Lisa, I would still be impressed because seeing the 1 and only artwork is still very cool. You can see it printed elsewhere but I don’t think it would affect me.

I think John talking about how he sees the difference between being naked and nude is interesting In episode 2.  At surface level a lot of people would probably assume they are the same thing. Another interesting part was when John said that when women’s bodies are on display, every feature like their hair etc is turned into a disguise which can’t be discarded. I think this is because photos and paintings last a long time. If you saw someone the memory would fade eventually, but when you see a portrait of someone, it will last a lot longer.

I think a lot of the things Berger mentions about advertisements in episode 4 still hold up today. It’s still true that we are advertised things in order to feel “glamorous” or to feel “rich”. Especially more than ever, a lot of times these products are paired up with celebrities. If a product is next to a rich successful person then people might buy the product to be like them. It seems like every single thing is an advertisement now a day and everywhere you look you will see one. A lot of times people will just buy stuff they see advertised and then end up using it, but in the end the company will just get their money. Its fascinating how even though this episode was made decades ago, a lot of the things mentioned are the same.
